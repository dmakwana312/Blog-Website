Fundamentals of Web Technology Mini-Project
### About
This repository contains the mini-project that was completed by myself for my Fundamentals of Web Technology module during the second semester at university. 

It is a simple blog website that uses PHP to carry out its functions. All blog entries are added to a database through the use of MySQL.

Currently the website is not live as it was only created for a university project.
